# Web-Search-Engine
This project focuses on web data crawling, collection, and storage, developed as part of my graduate course “Data Engineering and Management.” I built the system using PHP for backend processing, with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend interface. Crawled data is collected and stored in a MySQL database, enabling structured storage and easy access for analysis. The project demonstrates practical skills in data extraction and management using web technologies.
