# Web-Search-Engine

This is a Web Data Crawling, Collection, and Storage project. I used MYSQL to store and collect the Crawling Data. 
This project has developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
I did this project under the requirement of my graduate course " Data Engineering and Management".
